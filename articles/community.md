If possible, try to explain what behavior you expected and why. Bonus
points for contributing failing test cases.


## Contributing

Cassaforte uses [Leiningen 2](http://leiningen.org). Make sure you
have it installed and then run tests against supported Clojure
versions using

    lein2 all test

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done
with your changes and all tests pass, submit a pull request on GitHub.
